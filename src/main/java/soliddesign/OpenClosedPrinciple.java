    /*
    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension,
    but closed for modification.

    Violating the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) can introduce significant problems in software development.

     Here's what typically happens when you don't adhere to it: Â 

     Increased Risk of Introducing Bugs:
     Modifying existing code, especially code that's already working,
     increases the risk of introducing unintended side effects and bugs

     Reduced Maintainability:
     Each time you need to add or change something, you have to delve into the existing code,
     understand its intricacies, and make modifications.

     Reduced Reusability:
     Difficulty in Extending Functionality:
